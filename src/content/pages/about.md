I've spent the last decade following my curiosities, from law to criminal justice to software through entrepreneurship and mentoring. I learned a ton in the process - about leadership, diplomacy, building software and product, transitioning careers, how to learn and how to create great teams. 

I am fascinated by helping how can we make the tech world more human centered.

# Life Highlights 
- Educational background in international law with a specialisation in peace building through justice and conflict resolution. My expertise lied in finding and implementing alternatives to traditional forms of justice and peace building to reconstruct broken societies.

- I worked as a legal attach√© at the United Nations where I represented France in diplomatic duties, to then learn programming in search for more impact, opportunities, creativity, and fun! 

- I started over in 7 countries - Brazil, Peru, US, Canada, Netherlands, UK, Italy - new jobs, new struggles, new friends :)
